# Visualization_Challenge
This assignment looked at data from a study on 10 different drug regimens for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice. I sorted through the data to get rid of duplicates before performing analysis. We can see different trends and visualize the results through bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and linear regression within this assignment.
